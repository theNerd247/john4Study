% The 4 Spiritual Laws and Sharing The Gospel

# Intro

Matthew 28:19

A couple years ago I was flying to Texas to visit my family who had just moved
out there. I had recently been through some great disciplship by 5 guys
here at BCM. 

I had a refresshing relationship with Jesus and I was excited about all I was
learning!

I had always heard that airplanes were a great place for witnessing to others
because of their captive audience

So I thought, alright! I'll try it out. But, I couldn't. My mouth would go dry,
I knew I knew the Gospel but how do I share it?

Tonight we're going to look at 4 simple steps to sharing the Gospel with
others which was created for college students.

It's called the 4 spiritual laws and was made by Bill Bright the founder for
campus crusades.

These are 4 simple steps that are intended to guide your conversations with
others. By no means is it the law; there are many other ways to share the
gospel with other people

Turn to John 4 - let's see how the master teacher brought soemone to a
relationship with Him.

# Law 1 

v10 - "livng water"

__God loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.__
(_repeat_)

## Love

John 3:16

1 John 3:16

_HOT DOG!_ This is amazing isn't it?!

When was the last time you knew deep down that someone would lay their life
down for you?

God did! 

You may be asking yourself: "But Noah, aren't we supposed to start with sin?"

Starting with sin assumes that they know about God already.

In today's world many people haven't given God a second thought. So we must
start before sin started.

"God loves you" goes straight to the heart of man - each of us desire deep down
to be loved!

It helps to share the Gospel 

## Plan

God not only loves you, but he has a wonderful plan for your life!

When God created you He didn't just make you and then left your life to 
be carried out on your own.

_Eph 1:4_

From God's perspective your story began before time existed.

> God, as Creator, formed man, to be a vessel in which He could show forth His
> power and goodness. Man was not to have in himself a fountain of life, or
> strength, or happiness: the ever-living and only living One was each moment
> to be the Communicator to him of all that he needed.
> - _Waiting On God_, Andrew Murray

In otherwords:
* Man was created by God to bring Him glory
* God intented all of life to be enjoyed and reliant on Him.

_Eph 2:10_

# Law 2

v11 - v14

If God created us with such an immense capacity of life why aren't some of us 
experiencing this? 

Why do we not have a constant "living water" welling up within us?

This brings us to our 2nd Law

__Man is sinful and is seperated from God.__

v11 

Here's a picture of a deep well.

![Dry Well](./img/dryWell.jpg)

Jesus Himself is speaking in a metaphor in v13.

If you try and live by your own well you will keep thirsting?

How do you think that Jesus got the living water?

![Artiseian Well](./img/artesianWellDiagram.gif)

_Write down what you think the difference is between the two wells are_?

One is man-powered. The other isn't! 

Without God we can do nothing! We are spiritually dead.

_Romans 5:12_

![Man Is Separated From God](./img/seperatedMan.jpg)

When we are born we are born with a nature completely seperated from God. This
is what "death" means: Seperated.

_Romans 3:23_ says "For all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God!"

Today we try and draw from our own wells thinking that we can reach God, or
worse, live without Him!

_Write down some ways we try and live without God or reach Him by our own
efforts._

v15 - v18

In the Jewish culture of the day a woman could not divorce a man - she was
divorced by her husband.

This woman had been divorced, rejected 5 times! And is now to 

Let's be careful to not thrown stones at her! This woman represents many of us!

If you have ever tried to escape the pains of life by running to anything or
anyone but God then you and this woman are a lot alike!

Notice when she went to the well - 6 in the evening! She was hiding from others
because of her shame.

Since I was a child I battled with a very low self-image because of the kind of
home I grew up in. 

There are times in my life where I battle with dark and severe moments.

We each have a God shaped hole in our hearts.

# Law 3 

v19 - v26

So how do we restore the relationship with God? We don't - God already did.

__Jesus is God's only provision for man's sin__

1. He died

_Romans 5:8_

2. He rose from the grave

_1 Corinthians 15:3-6_

This is a historical fact. Check out some of Josh McDowell's resources online.

3. He is the ONLY Way

Today there is a common misonception that as long as we're a "good person"
we'll get to heaven!

_John 14:6_
_Romans 10:9_

Note this is not "believe and: "
* be baptized
* stop committing adultery
* go to Church
* read your Bible!

No where in this passage did Jesus require the woman to get her act together
before she accepted the Free Gift of God!

# Law 4

Head knowledge only goes so far.

The fourth spiritual law is:

__We must individually recieve Jesus Christ as Savior__ 


v28a

"So the woman left her waterpot"

Stop here. THere is some huge imagery here!

Will you, like this woman, leave your bucket. Leave your striving, and deep
empty well and accept the free Gift God is Giving you?

Remember the "gift" from v10?

_Ephesians 2:8-9_

God's gift is given to each of us and must be recieved by grace!

# Application

## Review

1. God Loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life
1. Man is sinful and therefore seperated from God
1. Jesus is God's only provision for man's sin
1. We must individually recieve Jesus as Savior to be saved. 

## Things to Remember

1. Remember that it is the Holy Spirit that does the work - your job is to pass
   on the information. It is the Holy Spirit's job to change their heart.  _1
   Corinthians 3:6_
1. Cultivate a loving relationship with Christ. The more I grow in Him the more
   I can't help but share it with others. 
1. But be careful! The lies of Satan will make you feel as though you are a
   worthless Christian if you don't witness to others constantly. No where in
   scripture is your salvation put into question because of your lack of
   witnessing.
